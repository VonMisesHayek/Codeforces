My solutions to some Codeforces problems, from a mathematician's point of view. My Codeforces handle is `friedrich_hayek`.

Here is a list of the problems with corresponding time and memory used.

|Problem|Time|Memory|Date|
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 4A-8 | 62ms | 0KB | May/10/2019 |
|71A-14|31ms|0KB|May/11/2019|

Note: There are at least 200 solutions, so it will take a while to put them all here.
